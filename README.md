  <h1 align="center">C# Console Games</h1>
</p>

This is a simple framework that makes it easier to create small console games using C#.
* `Engine` Handles things like rendering and input. Contains a static `Game` class used to run the game.
* `TestGame` Contains whatever I am working on at the moment. You should probably just ignore it.
* `GameOfLife` John Conway's Game of Life. Space to pause the game. Left mouse click to add tile, right to remove.
* `FirstPerson` A first-person game where you can walk around a small map. Walk with WASD. Rotate the camera with left and right mouse click.

The project is made in Visual Studio Community 2019 Version 16.9.2 using C# .Net Core 3.1. I have only tested on Windows 10, but since it uses Kernel32 I would guess it does not work on other platforms.

If you want to contribute to the project or have any questions feel free to get in touch :)
